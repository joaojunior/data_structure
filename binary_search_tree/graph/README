This is a Python Implementation of Graph.

It has the main methods insert_edge, remove_edge, edge_exist, remove_edge and adjacents.

#Big-O notation to worst-case
	- insert_edge: O(1)
	- remove_edge: O(1)
	- edge_exist: O(1)
	- remove_node: O(E), where E is the number of edges in the graph
	- adjacents: O(E), where E is the number of edges in the graph
