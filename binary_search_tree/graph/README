This is a Python Implementation of Graph and include the Breadth first search

It has the main methods insert_edge, remove_edge, edge_exist, remove_edge and adjacents.

#Big-O notation to worst-case in Graph
	- insert_edge: O(1)
	- remove_edge: O(1)
	- edge_exist: O(1)
	- remove_node: O(|E|), where E is the set of edges in the graph
	- adjacents: O(|E|), where E is the set of edges in the graph


#Big-O notation to worst-case in BFS
	- bfs: O(|V + E|), where V is the set of nodes and E is the set of edges in the graph
