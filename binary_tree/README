This is an implementation of BinaryTree in Python.

It has the methods: insert, search, remove, node_is_leaf, find_lead and _parent

# Big-o notation of the worst-case
here n is the number of items in the binary tree
	- insert: O(n), in the worstcase, the binary tree is like a linked-list
	- search: O(n), how the binary tree is not a search binary tree, is necessary looking for all the items in the worst-case
	- remove: O(n), is necessary search the item and then remove
    - node_is_leaf: O(1), verify only if the children are None
	- find_leaf: O(n), in the worstcase, the binary tree is like a linked-list and is necessary search in this
	- _parent: O(n), is necessary lokking for the item in the binary tree
