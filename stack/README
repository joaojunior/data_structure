This in an implementation of stack in python.

It has the methods: push and pop.

# Big-O notation of complexity in worst-case:
	- push: O(1), consider that insert one element in the final of the list in python is O(1)
	- pop: O(1), consider that remove one element from the begin of a list in python is O(1)
